**Link**: https://paolobaigueraunitn.github.io/
**What’s on the screen**: 
- Several fishes happily swimming within it. 
- Many Ripples expanding and contracting
**Interactions**:
- Mouse Click/Drag: If a fish is within the movement space, it moves away and reproduce a sound (a note assigned to it)
- Automated: Whenever a fish is within any Ripple’s area it plays the note and change his tail color. 
- Automated: Every 2 seconds the notes playing changes (according to 4 basics chord A, C#m, E, G#m)
**Results**:
	An interactive playground which creates an ever-changing 
	SoundScape. 

		
**Files and so on**
	All the project’s animations and paints are done through 	p5.js. This library works on top of web audio and is 	easy to use yet powerful when it comes to create 		canvases.
	
	So, just an index.html,index.js and a CSS stylesheet.
