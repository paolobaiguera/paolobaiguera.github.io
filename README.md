# ZEN NOT ZEN - THESE KOI FISHES REALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY. 
**Link**: https://paolobaigueraunitn.github.io/
**What’s on the screen**: 
- Several fishes happily swimming within it. 
- Many Ripples expanding and contracting
- Two sliders: Fishes and Ripples
**Interactions**:
- Mouse Click/Drag: If a fish is within the movement space, it moves away and reproduce a sound (a note assigned to it)
- Sliders: Moving the sliders add or remove respectively Fishes and Ripples.
- Automated: Whenever a fish is within any Ripple’s area it plays the note and change his tail color. 
- Automated: Every 2 seconds the notes playing changes (according to 4 basics chord A, C#m, E, G#m)
**Results**:
	An interactive playground which creates an ever-changing 
	SoundScape. 

		
**Files and so on**
	All the project’s animations and paints are done through 	p5.js. This library works on top of web audio and is 	easy to use yet powerful when it comes to create 		canvases.
	
	So, just an index.html,index.js and a CSS stylesheet.

**Give credits where credit’s due**
	I initially followed the Flocking tutorial in order to 	build a customizable framework displaying in-water
	movements. 
	I did not use this code directly, but I did learned a 	lot from these projects.
