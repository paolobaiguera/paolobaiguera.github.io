(Better with Headphones!!!)

**CHROME**: It was developed for Chrome and should work at his best on this browser.

**SAFARI ISSUE**: For Safari Users go to Preferenze -> Riproduzione Automatica -> rettare il valore associato questo sito a “Sempre”. It could also not work on some versions older than 14.0.

**What’s on the screen**: 

- Several fishes happily swimming within it. 

- Many Ripples expanding and contracting

- Two sliders: Fishes and Ripples

**Interactions**:

- Mouse Click: Create a new Ripple that lasts for only 1 second. In this way the user can choose which fish will play or simply add more momentary ripples.

- Mouse Drag: If a fish is within the dragging space it will disappear and re-render far from the mouse position.

- Sliders: Moving the sliders add or remove respectively Fishes and Ripples which last as long as the user likes

- Automated: Whenever a fish is within any Ripple’s area it plays the note and change his tail’s color. 

- Automated: Every 2 seconds the notes playing changes (either the C or the F pentatonic scale)

**Results**:

- An interactive playground which creates an ever-changing 
	SoundScape. 

		
**Files and so on**:

- All the project’s animations and paints are done through p5.js. This library works on top of web audio and is easy to use yet powerful when it comes to create canvases.
	So, just an index.html,index.js and a CSS stylesheet.

**Give credits where credit’s due**:

I initially followed the Flocking tutorial in order to 	build a customizable framework displaying in-water movements. 

I did not use this code directly, but I did learned a 	lot from these projects.
